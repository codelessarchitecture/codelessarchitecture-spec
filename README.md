# Specification for Codeless Architecture


This is a placeholder for an in-progress, working draft of the Codeless Architecture open specification.

As a standard, Codeless Architecture will prioritize openness, data compliance, extensibility, and easy integration with, and consumption by, external interfaces and systems.

This specification will provide the building blocks for defining codeless, enterprise-grade systems, as well as specifications aimed at enabling  consistent, multi-platform rendering and logic execution, allowing for open, free extension.
